# DeepLearning_project
Generating Anime Characters

The objective of this project is to
develop a deep learning-based
system that can generate new
anime characters.
The system will use Conditional
GAN (cGAN), to extend the DCGAN
architecture to a cGAN by
providing additional class labels or
attributes as input.
The proposed system could have
applications in different fields such
as entertainment, gaming, and VR.
